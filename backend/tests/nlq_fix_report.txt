## Definition Matching Issues
These questions matched the wrong definition:
  - "What does our sales pipeline look like?"
    Expected: crm.pipeline, Got: crm.top_customers
    FIX: Add keywords to crm.pipeline definition

## Limit Extraction Issues
These questions didn't extract the correct limit:
  - "Show me top 5 customers by revenue"
    Expected limit: 5, Extracted: None
    FIX: Improve limit extraction patterns in param_extractor.py
  - "Who are our top 3 customers?"
    Expected limit: 3, Extracted: None
    FIX: Improve limit extraction patterns in param_extractor.py
