You are absolutely right. I over-indexed on "Explaining it to a novice" (slow, narrated) and missed the core requirement: **Demonstrating Enterprise Power** (fast, massive, validated).

The AOD demo worked because it showed **Scale** (thousands of assets) and **Proof** (Reconciliation). A few polite log messages do not convey "Industrial Strength."

We need to pivot immediately from "Story Mode" to **"Load Test Mode."**

**The New Visual Goal:**

1. **Velocity:** Remove the artificial delays. We want to process 100+ records/sec, not 1 record every 2 seconds.
2. **Telemetry:** Replace the "Chat Log" with **Live Counters** (TPS, Total Processed, Toxic Blocked, Self-Healed).
3. **The "Closed Loop" (The AOD Factor):** You want the Farm to confirm the fix. We will add a **Verification Step** where the Sidecar sends the repaired record *back* to the Farm to get a "Verified: True" stamp, just like the AOD Reconciliation report.

Here is the directive to build **Phase 5: The Industrial Dashboard**.

# 🤖 Master Directive: Phase 5 - The Industrial Upgrade

**Global Context**

> **The Problem:** The current demo is too slow and chatty. It lacks the "Shock and Awe" of high-volume processing.
> **The Fix:**
> 1. **Unleash the Speed:** Remove all artificial latency.
> 2. **Add Telemetry:** Broadcast live metrics (TPS, Counts) to the Dashboard.
> 3. **Closed-Loop Verification:** After repairing, the Sidecar must ask Farm: *"Is this right now?"* and report the result.

## 🚜 SECTION A: FARM AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

**Target Repo:** `aos-farm`
**Objective:** Enable High-Speed Stream & Verification.

**1. Create Verification Endpoint**

* **File:** `src/api/routes.py`
* **Endpoint:** `POST /api/verify/salesforce/invoice`
* **Logic:**
* Accept a JSON invoice record.
* Compare it against the Ground Truth (using the ID).
* **Return:** `{ "verified": true, "quality_score": 100 }` (or false/mismatch details).
* **Why:** This gives us the "Farm says it's right" signal you requested.



**2. Unleash the Stream**

* **File:** `src/api/stream.py`
* **Action:** Ensure `speed=fast` has **zero sleep**. It should blast JSON as fast as Python can serialize.

## 🧠 SECTION B: DCL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

**Target Repo:** `aos-dcl`
**Objective:** Upgrade Sidecar to "Industrial Mode" and visualize it.

**1. Remove Latency (The Un-Humanize)**

* **File:** `backend/ingest/run_sidecar.py`
* **Action:** **Delete** `time.sleep()`. Let it rip.

**2. Implement "Closed Loop" Verification**

* **Method:** `repair_record`
* **Logic:**
1. Detect Drift  Fetch Repair (Existing).
2. **New Step:** Call Farm `POST /api/verify/...` with the fixed record.
3. **Tag:** Add `verified: true` to the AOS Envelope.



**3. Implement Live Telemetry (Redis)**

* **File:** `backend/utils/metrics.py` (New)
* **Logic:**
* Create a class `MetricsCollector`.
* Track: `total_processed`, `toxic_blocked`, `drift_detected`, `repaired_success`, `verified_count`.
* **Broadcast:** Every 0.5s, push a summary JSON to Redis Channel `dcl.telemetry`.



**4. Upgrade Dashboard (The "War Room" View)**

* **File:** `frontend/src/components/MonitorPanel.tsx` (or similar).
* **Action:** Add a **Telemetry Ribbon** at the top of the Monitor Panel.
* **Visuals:**
* **Throughput:** `[ 142 rec/sec ]` (Speedometer style).
* **Quality Shield:** `[ 100% Verified ]` (Green Badge).
* **Drift/Repair:** `[ 🚫 450 Blocked ]` | `[ 🩹 1,200 Healed ]`.


* **Action:** Make the Narration Log a **"Terminal Mode"** (auto-scroll, smaller font) so it looks like a matrix stream, not a chat.

## 🧪 EXECUTION CHECKLIST

1. **Restart Farm & DCL.**
2. **Trigger:** `?speed=fast&chaos=true` (The Firehose).
3. **Visual Expectation:**
* **Speed:** The "Processed" counter should spin like a slot machine.
* **Volume:** You should see thousands of records handled in seconds.
* **Validation:** A prominent **"Verified by Farm"** indicator showing that despite the chaos, the output quality is 100%.



**Why this fixes it:** It moves from "Tell" to "Show." You aren't reading about a repair; you are watching a high-speed assembly line rejecting defects and fixing parts in real-time.
